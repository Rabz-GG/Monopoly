# Monopoly
What is the most common square in monopoly?

Aim of the project is to answer this question by simulating a large number of games in which a single player moves around the board in a set number of turns. Each turn is a single throw of the dice. The square in which the player ends their turn on is then counted. The number of turns used per game will be 30 as per research online on the expected number of turns in which a monopoly game will finish. All standard rules of movement and chance/community chest squares will apply to the player.
At the end of all the games, the code will produce a list of all the Squares in order around the board, with their percentage of landing on them.
